# Monte Carlo Maze Runner

This project focuses on understanding and implementing Monte Carlo
simulation techniques to model uncertainty and analyze outcomes.
The project is being developed step-by-step as part of an internship.

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to build a Monte Carlo simulation
engine that demonstrates random sampling, convergence behavior,
and lays the foundation for future risk analysis applications.

## Day 1 Progress

On Day 1, the focus was on understanding Monte Carlo simulation
fundamentals and validating the concept through a working prototype.

- Studied Monte Carlo simulation concepts
- Designed a basic system architecture
- Implemented a mobile-based proof of concept
- Tested convergence behavior using different sample sizes


## Proof of Concept (PoC)

A mobile-based Monte Carlo simulation was developed using HTML and
JavaScript to estimate the value of π (pi). The simulation generates
random points and estimates π based on the ratio of points inside
a quarter circle.


## Experimental Results

The simulation was tested using multiple sample sizes (100, 500,
and 1000 samples). The results demonstrate the stochastic nature
of Monte Carlo simulations and show convergence toward the actual
value of π as sample size increases.
